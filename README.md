# Air_Mouse

The Air Mouse project transforms an Arduino UNO into a motion-based mouse. By using sensors and a Python script, it captures hand movements and translates them into cursor movements on the computer screen.

# Features:
* **Motion Detection:** Utilizes sensors to detect hand movements.
* **Real-time Cursor Control:** Translates detected movements into real-time cursor control on the computer.
* **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Python Integration:** Uses Python for processing sensor data and controlling the cursor.

# Components:
* Arduino UNO
* ADXL335 (3-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope module)
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard
* USB cable
